## About me

I received my PhD degree in July 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Ying Tan at the Key Laboratory of machine perception and intelligence, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University (EECS, PKU).

I received my B.S. of Intelligence Science and Technology in Nankai University and a dual degree of Business Administration from the Tianjin University in 2015.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on machine learning and applications. In particular, I am working on On-Device LLMs Personalization. Preivous interests inlclude Reinforcement Learning, Mechansim Design, Game Theory, Evolutionary Computation and their applications, e.g., mechanism design in e-commerce advertising and game AI.

_Nothing is more practical than a good theory._
