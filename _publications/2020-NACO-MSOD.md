**Abstract:**
With the wide use of electromagnetic information equipment, a large number of wireless radiation systems coexisting in the same region produce intentional or unintentional interference on electronic receivers. For the purpose of intentional electromagnetic interference, it is necessary to realise the efficient suppression of other receivers at little cost. When multiple transmitting sources are used to interfere with multiple receivers, the parameters of multiple transmitting sources are required to be comprehensively optimised and set so as to achieve a desired high-efficiency interference. Therefore, we propose a novel method to optimise the setting of parameters of a multi-source, multi-object and multi-domain (M-SOD) interference system based on intelligent optimisation approaches. Furthermore, this study also builds an intelligent optimisation model, which contains multiple transmitters and receivers which involved many parameters include position, direction of space domain, frequency, bandwidth, and power. Then the model is abstracted to the problem of singleobjective optimisation with constraints and optimised through a traditional GA and an improved FWA method. The extensive experiments and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for setting the parameters of an M-SOD electromagnetic interference system and superior to the conventional method.
